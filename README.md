# Fusion Shell — native Android development

Open **[`android/`](android/README.md)** in Android Studio. That is the Kotlin /
Jetpack Compose application, not a browser recreation.

The existing root `src/`, npm files and Vite configuration are legacy web work;
they are not the Android product, were not extended in this pass, and are not
part of the Android build.

**This is an incomplete implementation with limited API34 emulator testing of the owner's
v2.0 + v2.1 specification.** No release-complete or performance claim is made.
See [build instructions](android/docs/BUILD.md),
[current verification status](android/STATUS.md), and the
[231-row requirement ledger](android/requirements.csv).

Latest: [R12 engineering and exact evidence](android/docs/R12-ENGINEERING.md).
[Substantial testable subsets:23/48 (47.92%)](android/docs/MODULE-TESTABILITY.md).
**0/48 specification-accepted modules (0%); not a production-ready beta.**
